ros-jazzy-axis-msgs (0.5.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Major overhaul for better PTZ support (#80 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/axis_camera/issues/80>)
    * Move the messages out of the driver and into their own package
    * Migrating essential components into the src folder so we can use a single ROS node to contain both the video & ptz functionality. Start filling necessary messages & services for incoming features
    * Remove the old axis and axis_ptz nodes, roll both into the new axis_camera_node script with the backends moved to the src directory
    * Remove the dynamic_reconfigure, strip the PTZ controller down to just controlling pan, tilt, and zoom; don't set brightness, white balance, etc.... Add support for velocity & position control topics, change the driver to use radians instead of degrees
    * Re-implement the teleop controls to use the PS4 controller. Fix some bugs found during testing
    * Expose the joy topic as an arg to make remapping easier
    * Use rad/s instead of [-100, 100] for pan & tilt velocity control
    * Re-implement brightness/iris/focus/etc... support via individual services & topics instead of all combined into a single one.
    * Latch the wiper, night-mode, and defogger topics instead of publishing at 1Hz. Prevent the wiper from being turned on if it's already on & running
    * Add meshes & URDF files for a fixed dome camera, PTZ dome camera, and the Q62 PTZ camera
    * Update the default camera frame ID to match the new description files
    * Update the plugin name for the dome camera model
    * Fixes after testing on hardware

ros-jazzy-axis-msgs (0.4.6-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Wait until camera is online before connecting (#78 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/axis_camera/issues/78>)
    * Add a wait loop to prevent execution until the camera responds to a ping. This should prevent issues where the node starts while the camera is still powering-on, resulting in some excessive errors
    * Clear the camera position after publishing the state to avoid issues where we republush the same state ad nauseum if there's an error
